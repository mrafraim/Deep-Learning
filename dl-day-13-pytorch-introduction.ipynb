This is more intuitive for debugging and experimentation.  \n","- **NumPy-like syntax**: If you know NumPy, PyTorch feels familiar, making it easy to transition to deep learning.  \n","- **Research + production**: Widely adopted by researchers for experiments and by engineers for production deployments.  \n","- **Community & ecosystem**: Strong support, libraries, tutorials, and pre-trained models available.\n","\n","## Summary\n","\n","- PyTorch is a tool to simplify deep learning.  \n","- It handles tensors, gradients, and optimization automatically.  \n","- Makes training, debugging, and experimenting with neural networks far easier.  \n","- Essential for building modern deep learning models quickly and safely.\n","\n","## Quick Mental Model\n","\n","Think of PyTorch as a smart math engine:\n","\n","1. You define your inputs, weights, and operations.  \n","2. You do a forward pass → PyTorch calculates outputs.  \n","3. You do a backward pass → PyTorch computes all gradients automatically.  \n","4.
